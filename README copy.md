# Below Orbit

Below Orbit is a thrilling sci-fi descent game where you play as a cosmic explorer lowered deep into an alien world, tethered only by a fragile lifeline to your orbiting ship. The deeper you go, the greater the riskâ€”but also the rarer the loot. Dodge obstacles, outmaneuver gravitational anomalies, and collect ancient artifacts before calling for extraction. One wrong move and the tether snaps... do you dare descend just a little farther?
